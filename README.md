<BR>

This Compact Reservoir is a modified version of the BW 2018 Ball Pump by Brian Alano.
<BR>
I wanted to build a small reservoir module with large overhangs to sue at corners of my GBC setup, and chose to modify this well-built, reliable ball pump for the purpose.
<BR>
The pumping mechanics of this reservoir are unchanged from the original design.  Some structural and aesthetic changes have been made to support the geometry of this reservoir.
